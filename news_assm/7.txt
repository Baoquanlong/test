Zhaolijian:China opposes any country imposing its own interests and requirements on other countries, opposes "small circles" and group politics against third parties, and opposes dividing the world with ideological lines.
And, for a long time, Chinese companies including Huawei have actively participated in the economic construction of the UAE and made important contributions to the economic and social development of the UAE. They have been highly recognized by UAE partners. China and Afghanistan maintain regular communication on bilateral relations and issues of common concern, and have broad consensus. We all believe that China-Arab cooperation is in the common interests of both sides, benefits the two peoples, has nothing to do with a third party, and does not allow for interference by a third party.

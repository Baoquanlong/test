We firmly support the just actions of the SAR government and the police to strictly enforce the law, and firmly support all efforts to maintain national security and the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.　　 The statement emphasized that the Basic Law guarantees that Hong Kong residents enjoy the freedom of speech, news, and publication, but any right and freedom are not borderless and cannot break through the bottom line of national security. This is also the express provisions of relevant international conventions and the general practice of laws in various countries. Hong Kong is a society under the rule of law. Everyone is equal before the law. There is no exception, including media organizations. Freedom of the press is not a "shield" for illegal activities. Anyone who violates the Hong Kong National Security Law and related laws will be severely sanctioned by the law, regardless of their professional status and background, regardless of the support behind them.　　 On the 17th, the National Security Service of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Police arrested five company directors on suspicion of “conspiring to collude with foreign countries or foreign forces to endanger national security” in violation of the Hong Kong National Security Law.
